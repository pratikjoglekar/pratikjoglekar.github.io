            <h2>Authenticated Dashboard & Product Pages —</h2>
            <h5>Website</h5>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/dashboard.png">
<!--            <p class="sp-24"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/massmutual/id1516539101" class="primary" target="_blank">MassMutual App</a></p>-->
            <p class="sp-16">A Customer can view all their products and policies online in the authenticated space.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">I participated in the end-to-end dashboard redesign process while collaborating with another designer and led the product/policy redesign process while working with Product Owners and engineers.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">Skill Highlights —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">
              <ul>
                <li><b><u>Lead:</u> </b>Connected with stakeholders and customer expectations and aligned the Designs by working closely with the Product Owner to deliver designs.</li>
                <li><b><u>Influence:</u> </b>Another designer and I convinced the engineering team to create new APIs and make a more user-focused experience.</li>
                <li><b><u>Innovation:</u> </b>As a design team, we got a chance to define the dashboard with additional customer-centric features to make the experience far more attuned.</li>
                <li><b><u>Collaboration:</u> </b>Partnered with another designer to create the new dashboard experience and continued working with the product owner and engineering for the dashboard and policy/product pages.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">The Challenge —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">The previous dashboard UI did not share much with the user. So the team and I, along with the other designer, strategized to create a new dashboard design to make the experience more user-friendly. I also wanted to extend the same experience to MassMutual's policy and product pages to keep it consistent, provide navigation relief, and elevate the experience.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">The challenge was to convince stakeholders to migrate to this new design that would provide customers with an experience that would give a high-level overview of their entire account.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">Design Process —</h3>
            <p class="sp-16">The data team shared some web statistics that led us to think about making the UI more intuitive. We looked at the heatmaps and funnels of the existing experience and decided on our next steps.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Generative Research —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/generative.png">
            <p class="sp-16">We had to identify the more profound needs of our customers to create a set of opportunities we could prioritize. We then partnered with the research team to create a study guide.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">I also worked on a competitive analysis alongside qualitative research to identify a competitive edge.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">After the research, I validated the hypothesis that customers would prefer having more visibility of their accounts on the dashboard. They would also like to have more visibility on their policy/product pages and align with the new design.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Identify Goals —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/brainstorm.png">
            <p class="sp-16">Comparing analytical data with the key insights from the study. I conducted a workshop to facilitate rapid idea generation. It was a series of brainstorming sessions for the dashboard, followed by the policy/product pages.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">Based on the study and brainstorming session, we shared the ideas with our stakeholders to align with their expectations.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Design Wireframes —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/wireframe.png">
            <p class="sp-16">Once we alignment with stakeholders, we created a bunch of wireframes with creative solutions based on the insight sheet. It was a highly iterative process that went through various evaluations. Finally, we ended with two directions for the dashboard and policy/product pages.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Rapid Validations —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/validation.png">
            <p class="sp-16">I connected with the PO and engineering team to share our objectives and expectations for the usability study. This alignment allowed them to headstart the project development based on some outlined goals.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">The concept designs were different, but the data was the same, which gave the team a sense of purpose and drive for the upcoming work. At the end of the study, there was a clear direction we pursued.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Design System and Visual Design —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/design.png">
            <p class="sp-16">Since the design had a very different visual language than the existing UI, there was a need to create a brand new Design system. I collaborated with multiple designers to create a Design system that will be used for all other projects in the authenticated space.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">The Result —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">We continued validating our visual designs. After the first iteration, we validated the hypothesis that users would prefer having more visibility on their dashboard followed by the policy/product pages..</p>
            <p class="sp-16">Later, we continued monitoring the data and making minor tweaks to the design.</p>

            <p class="sp-16">MassMutual app helps customers manage their Life insurance and Annuities details in one place. Customers can handle payments, review balances, pay down premiums, review policy info, and much more!</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">As a product designer, I lead the end-to-end design effort, while collaborating with product owner, engineering.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">Skill Highlights —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">
              <ul>
                <li><b><u>Lead:</u> </b>I spearheaded the entire design effort for the product from inception That included talking with stakeholders to visual design.</li>
                <li><b><u>Influence:</u> </b>I worked closely with the product and engineering team to constantly remind and connect it user insights.</li>
                <li><b><u>Understanding Tech and Legal:</u> </b>Learning most of the legal and compliance expectations and collaborated with engineering to overcome legacy hurdles.</li>
                <li><b><u>Collaboration:</u> </b>Involved product management and engineering at the beginning of any new feature design.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">The Challenge —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">Two years ago, MassMutual had a digital presence only on the web. I was appointed as the lead designer to create a mobile experience that supported the web.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">The main challenge was to translate the web experience to mobile. The hypothesis was customers would prefer to have easy access to their insurance and annuity products on mobile.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">Design Process —</h3>
            <p class="sp-16">I wanted to break the entire experience into manageable chunks, so I started by learning more about the web experience even before I dove into identifying the need for mobile.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Discover —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/mobilebrainstorm.png">
            <p class="sp-16">I created a moderation guide that included the goal, hypothesis, and questions. I then collaborated with the research team, who conducted the interviews and helped generate insights. I also created a tentative structure based on the web and competitive analysis.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Benchmarking —</h4>
<!--            <img src="images/codi/cover.png" class="picture">-->
            <p class="sp-16">I also wanted to make sure we align with the web yet enhance the experience for a mobile experience. So, I did a heuristic analysis and created a priority list.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Seat at the table —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/seatatthetable.png">
            <p class="sp-16">I worked closely with the product owner to align the user expectations and app roadmap. We had to hash out user and business priorities and make something we could agree on.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Design Wireframes —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/mobilewireframe.png">
            <p class="sp-16">After the team alignment, I scribbled some ideas to get the flow right. Initially, I began to map the overall web experience and instigated it to the mobile experience and wireframes to support it.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">Validations —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/mobilevalidation.png">
            <p class="sp-16">As the engineering team continued building the product, I conducted usability studies to ensure the future experiences get validated. Depending on UX, I had to identify the best possible research method to get the best possible insight. After every research and looking at the insights, I triaged the experience and created well-defined designs.</p>
            <h4 class="sp-48 subtext">High Fidelity Designs —</h4>
            <img class="sp-16 picture" src="images/massmutual/mobiledesign.png">
            <p class="sp-16">It all comes down to the final UI and how the entire research is brought to fruition. I followed a design guideline for mobile to create a design system and use those components to define the final visuals.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">The Result —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">On July 20, 2020, MassMutual launched MassMutual App. It started as a lean process, but we quickly adopted and launched new features almost every quarter.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">The app successfully achieved the goal to be consistent with the web while making it unique as a mobile app.</p>

I collaborated with the product team to create strategies for user acquisition, end-to-end experience - identifying existing experience drawbacks, wireframing, and user study. I also worked with other teams to find best locations to promote paperless.</p>
