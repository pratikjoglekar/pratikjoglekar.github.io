            <p class="sp-16">Previously, HubSpot employees lacked a method to organize and monitor events using the data HubSpot possesses about their customers in an organized manner. With the Usage Library, HubSpot employees can now view all customer-related events and have it available for both amplitude and other analytical platforms. This tool also allows teams to establish uniform data practices, safeguard the information, and ensure its accuracy.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">My job was to design the end-to-end experience. I focused on how events are created and changed, and how this affects analytical tools. Along with that I also created a designs to better structure data for accessibility. One of my main goals was to make sure all customer data was safe, reliable, and easy to use.</p>

            <h2>Usage Library: Event Creation Flow —</h2>
            <h5>Website</h5>

            <p class="sp-16">The usage library was mainly used to store all events. However, there was a big problem with creating events. There was no way to track or record when events were created or edited. To fix this, I suggested making a system that used a database. Users could easily create events through the interface instead of using a code file.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">The primary objective of my efforts was to understand the current system and identify areas for enhancement. It became evident that we required a framework for creating and modifying events. To ensure the success of the tool, I extensively researched through interviews and usability studies the user expectations and translated them into actionable designs.</p>

            <h2>Usage Library: Advance Anomaly Detection —</h2>

            <p class="sp-16">The system employs machine learning to detect any irregularities in the data, enabling teams to detect and address critical issues at an earlier stage. The majority of the data holds significance for the company, and the teams can set up event configurations to pinpoint particular occurrences they wish to monitor.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">Worked closely with engineers and the ML team to pinpoint potential for improved anomaly detection. Developed a design that considered both technical capabilities and business needs. Subsequently, I carried out a usability analysis to fine-tune and solidify the designs for implementation.</p>

            <p class="sp-16">Due to their vulnerability to market changes, small businesses are especially sensitive to pricing. In fact, 25% of customers opt to cancel their automatic renewal in order to save money. However, it takes HubSpot 2 years to recoup the cost of acquiring a customer. In order to retain these customers, we incentivized them with a discount during the cancellation process.</p>
            <p class="sp-16">Additionally, we took into account their ongoing engagement with the product and aimed to introduce them to new tools and features or remind them about ones they may have forgotten about.</p>
            <h3 class="sp-64 subtext">My Role —</h3>
            <p class="sp-24">In order to address legal and pricing concerns, I had to work closely with both the legal and fintech departments. Additionally, I partnered with the analyst to gather data for an informed decision and devised a plan that would enable users to take advantage of discounts while still utilizing HubSpot products.</p>
            <p class="sp-24">In order to involve users, I implemented a variety of growth initiatives aimed at further engaging them with the product. These efforts involved conducting experiments to determine the most effective prompts for targeted user engagement.</p>
